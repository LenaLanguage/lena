# Security Policy for Lena

## Introduction

The safety of the Lena project is our priority. We are seriously related to any reports of potential vulnerabilities in our project and ask the community to help us in ensuring security.

## How to report vulnerability

If you find a potential vulnerability in Lena, please inform us of [robotsvision.vx@gmail.com]. I call for confidentiality until a correction is developed.

## Consideration of messages

1. Upon receipt of a message about vulnerability, I immediately proceed to its assessment.
2. I am working on the development of correction and coordination of its release.
3. After the release of correction, we inform the community about the problem and thank the researcher.

## Gratitude

I thank everyone who contributes to the security of our project. Your work is valued.

# Important information

Prior to the official release of Lena programming language, more accurate and detailed information about the safe use of the language is not available.
